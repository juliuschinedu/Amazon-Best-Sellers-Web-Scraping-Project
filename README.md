# Amazon-Best-Sellers-Web-Scraping-Project
This project involves web scraping data from Amazon India's best-sellers in the Teaching &amp; Education category. Using Python libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas, I extracted details about the top 50 books, including their authors and ratings. Additionally, I visualized the data to uncover trends and insights.
